# connect6

## Introduction

The objective of the project was
1.  To develop an algorithm on a microcontroller to play the famous board game Connect-6.
2.  To enable continuous communication with the PC application throughout the game,

            a.To obtain the assigned color by the server
            b.To transmit/receive the coordinates (row number, column number) of each move by a player.
            c.To receive an indication when one player achieves the target and to stop the game after that.
